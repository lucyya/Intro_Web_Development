* Overall, building wireframing is important for UX problems because important problems could be generated (and probably solved) during this process without too much cost and unnecessary distractions.
* Find out the problem and the target users, and design the project accordingly.
* Keep in mind the problem and target users throughout the process!
* Thinking about the workflow while sketching might generate critical issues never thought about. 
* Better show the workflow, but how detail it is depends on the audience.
* Don't spend too much unnecessary time on using tools!!!
